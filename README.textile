h1. Rationale

I use the same general skeleton for projects using MASON and GeoMASON with Scala over and over. This git repository and script lets me get started quickly.

h2. Usage

The script requires that you have git, wget, and bash installed.

To start a project, run:

<pre><code>wget https://raw.github.com/jbn/ScalaPlusMasonSkeleton/master/make_mason_project.sh; bash -e make_mason_project.sh; rm make_mason_project.sh</code></pre>

and follow the input prompts.

This will create a new directory with the initialized sbt project. @cd@ to that directory, then run do the obvious:

<pre><code>sbt</code></pre>
